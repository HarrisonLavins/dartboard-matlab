# MATLAB Dartboard

**Version 1.0.0**

Building a Dartboard on a Cartesian Grid in MATLAB

---

In this script, we will construct a rough approximation of a standard
English dartboard using a 512X512 matrix whose coordinates can be used to
return the point values represented by each location on the board.

The finished matrix is then visualized and displayed to the user, but the matrix can instead be used
and built upon to make a variety of fun and intersting dartboard game simulations.

# Inspiration & References

This project was inspired by the work of Sathyanarayan Rao, whose original construction of the basic wedges
and formation of the dartboard were used as the basis of this project. The code has been altered significantly to 
assign proper point values to each area of the board and form a board that more closely resembles a standard English dartboard.
